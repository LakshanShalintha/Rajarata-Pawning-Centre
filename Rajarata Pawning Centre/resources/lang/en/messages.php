                    Next.js API Routes (built-in): Since Next.js provides API routes, you can handle server-side logic right within your Next.js app. This can be useful for simpler applications or when you want to keep the backend tightly integrated with your frontend.

                    Advantages: Easy setup, no need for a separate backend service, works well for serverless environments.
                    Use cases: Small to medium-sized applications, serverless functions, or when you need simple API endpoints.
                    Node.js with Express: This is a popular combination for building a scalable backend. You can use Express to handle routes, middleware, and databases.

                    Advantages: Efficient data querying, real-time updates with subscriptions, works well with modern frontends.
                    Use cases: Applications requiring fine-grained data fetching or those needing real-time data.
                    Firebase or Supabase: If you prefer a serverless approach or don’t want to manage your own backend infrastructure, Firebase or Supabase could be suitable options. Both provide authentication, databases, file storage, and more.
